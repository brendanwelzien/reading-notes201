# HTML Chapter 15 Layout
## Key Concepts in Positioning Elements

- building blocks: CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. The box will either be *block-level* or *inline box*
- if one block level element sits inside another block level element then the outer box is the *containing / parent* element

## Controlling the Position of Elements
- positioning schemes:
    - normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning
    - you can use the *position* or *float* property

- to indicate where a box should be positioned, you may need to use *box offset* properties to tell browser how far from top or bottom and left or right
- when you move any element from normal flow, boxes can overlap... using *z-index* property allows you to control which box appears on top.
